# Disabled Features

This document provides information about the features that are currently
disabled on this website.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard feature is currently disabled because it needs more development. It should show all pull requests that the user has merged, but it is not working properly. When user logs in using Clerk, the dashboard will get stuck in a loop and will not show the user's pull requests immidiately. After clicking somewhere else on the website, the dashboard will show the user's pull requests. The pull request table also needs to be styled properly.

Currently, when "Dashboard" text is replaced with text "Login" in the navigation bar, the dashboard feature is disabled.

## Leaderboard

The Leaderboard feature is currently disabled because it needs more development. It should show the top contributors of the website, but is not always fetching the data from MongoDB.
