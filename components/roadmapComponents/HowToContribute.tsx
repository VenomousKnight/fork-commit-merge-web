          How to make an Open Source Contribution?
        </h2>
        <p className='pt-8 leading-6'>
          Contributing to open-source projects is a collaborative effort that
          offers the opportunity to learn, grow, and engage with the community.
          <br />
          Here&apos;s how you can get started:
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>1. Find a Project:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Identify a project that interests you. Many projects specifically mark
          issues as &quot;good for beginners&quot;, &quot;good first issue&quot;
          or similar to that to help you find a starting point. Some excellent
          places for looking these kind of issues are for example{' '}
          <a
            href='https://goodfirstissues.com'
            className='text-blue-400 hover:underline'
            target='blank'
          >
            goodfirstissues.com.
          </a>{' '}
          and{' '}
          <a
            href='https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners'
            className='text-blue-400 hover:underline'
            target='blank'
          >
            Awesome for Beginners - GitHub repository
          </a>
          .
          <br />
          <br />
          However, you don&apos;t necessary have to start looking for issues,
          you can also start really small with just finding typos or broken
          links in the documentation such as in the README or CONTRIBUTING files
          on different repositories and making a pull request. This is a great
          way to get started with open source contributions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Just remember that the contributions should be meaningful and add some value to the project. Don&apos;t just make a pull request for the sake of making a pull request. Make sure that the changes you are making are actually useful and meaningful, and that you are following the guidelines and coding standards of the project. Maintainers of the project are usually very busy and they don&apos;t have time to review pull requests that are not meaningful for the project.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2. Understand the Contribution Process:</strong> <br />
          <br />
          Review the project&apos;s README and CONTRIBUTING files, if available,
          to understand the contribution process, code of conduct, and
          requirements as the repository might have specific instructions on how
          to contribute to that project. Some projects might also have different
          rules. For example, some projects might require you to create an issue
          first before making a pull request. If you are unsure about anything,
          you can always ask the maintainers of the project.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>3. Fork and Clone:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Fork the repository to your account, and clone it to your local
          machine. Create a new branch for your changes.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>4. Make Your Changes:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Make the necessary changes or additions to the code, following the
          project&apos;s coding standards and guidelines.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>5. Test Your Changes:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality by
          running any available tests.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>6. Commit and Push:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Commit your changes with a clear and concise message describing what
          you did. Push the changes to your fork on GitHub.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>7. Create a Pull Request:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Open a pull request (PR) in the original repository, providing details
          of the changes and why they were made. Follow any further instructions
          or requests from the maintainers.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>8. Stay Engaged:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Respond to any comments or feedback on your PR and be ready to make
          additional changes if requested. You should also get email from GitHub
          each time someone comments on your pull request. You can also
          subscribe to the repository to get notifications about new issues and
          pull requests.
          <br />
          Also, we recommend downloading the GitHub mobile app to your phone.
          <br />
          <a
            href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&hl=en&gl=US'
            className='text-blue-400 hover:underline'
            target='blank'
          >
            Download GitHub app for Android
          </a>
          <br />
          <a
            href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905'
            className='text-blue-400 hover:underline'
            target='blank'
          >
            Download GitHub app for iOS
          </a>
          .<br />
          It&apos;s a great way to stay up to date with your notifications and
          you can also use it to merge pull requests and do other things on the
          go.
