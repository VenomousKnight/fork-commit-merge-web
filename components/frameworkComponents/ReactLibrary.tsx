        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is React?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          React (or React.js) is a JavaScript library for building user
          interfaces. Created and maintained by Facebook, it allows developers
          to create complex UIs from isolated and reusable components. React
          uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use React?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          React has several advantages including its component-based
          architecture, strong community support, and flexibility. Its reactive
          updates make it ideal for building dynamic and complex applications,
          while features like hooks and context make state management easier.
          Its compatibility with other libraries and tools like Redux and
          GraphQL make it extremely versatile.
