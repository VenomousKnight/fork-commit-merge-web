        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Django?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid
          development and clean, pragmatic design. Created by Adrian Holovaty
          and Simon Willison, it was first released in 2005. Django follows the
          &quot;batteries-included&quot; philosophy, offering a wide array of
          built-in features like an admin panel, ORM, and authentication support
          to help developers build robust web applications.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Django?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Django is a versatile framework suitable for both small and large
          projects. Its &apos;batteries-included&apos; philosophy means that
          developers can accomplish more with less code, focusing on writing the
          app rather than boilerplate. It also offers strong community support,
          excellent documentation, and a variety of third-party packages.
          Security features like SQL injection protection, CSRF protection, and
          password hashing are built-in, making it a secure choice for web
          development.
