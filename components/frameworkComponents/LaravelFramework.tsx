        <p className="mb-4">
          Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework designed for the
          development of web applications. Created by Taylor Otwell in 2011,
          Laravel provides an elegant syntax and a variety of tools that make it
          easier for developers to tackle common web development tasks such as
          routing, caching, authentication, and more.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Laravel?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Laravel has gained popularity for its ease of use, scalability, and
          modern toolkit. It comes with a powerful ORM called Eloquent, an
          elegant query builder, and a robust set of features for routing,
          sessions, and caching. It also includes a vibrant ecosystem of
          libraries and tools like Laravel Mix, Laravel Nova, and Laravel Vapor
          for various development needs.
