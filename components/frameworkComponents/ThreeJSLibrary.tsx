        <p className="mb-4">
          Three (or Three.js) is a 3D library that extends the Canvas API and
          WebGL. It offers a comprehensive set of features for creating and
          interacting with 3D designs and animations in web applications. First
          released on April 24, 2010, the library has received contributions
          from various developers to enhance its capabilities. It also utilizes
          the latest ES modules to improve both the library and the developer
          experience.
