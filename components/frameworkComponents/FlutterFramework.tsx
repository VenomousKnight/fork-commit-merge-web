        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Flutter?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit for building natively compiled
          applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
          Developed by Google, Flutter allows developers to craft high-quality
          native interfaces on both iOS and Android platforms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Flutter?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Flutter offers a robust set of widgets and a highly customizable UI,
          enabling a rich user experience. It allows developers to write code
          once and run it on multiple platforms, reducing both development time
          and cost. Its hot-reload feature enhances developer productivity by
          allowing instant updates without losing the app state. Flutter also
          has a strong community and a wide range of plugins, making it easier
          to add functionality to apps.
