        <p className="mb-4">
          Erlang is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming
          language and runtime environment. Developed by Ericsson in the late
          1980s, it was initially designed for telecommunication systems but has
          since found applications in various other sectors like ecommerce,
          computer telephony, and instant messaging.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Erlang?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Erlang is well-suited for systems that are distributed,
          fault-tolerant, and soft real-time. It has strong support for
          concurrent processes and offers features for hot-swapping running
          code, making it easier to upgrade systems without downtime.
