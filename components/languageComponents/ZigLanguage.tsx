        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Zig?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Zig is a general-purpose programming language designed for robustness,
          optimality, and maintainability. Introduced in 2016 by Andrew Kelley,
          it aims to be a simpler and safer alternative to languages like C and
          C++. Zig is often lauded for its focus on providing the programmer
          with total control over the hardware while also aiming to catch errors
          at compile-time whenever possible.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Zig?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Zig is advantageous for low-level system programming, similar to C,
          but also aims to improve safety and readability. It offers powerful
          compile-time code execution, simple syntax, and first-class debugging
          support. Zig&apos;s ability to cleanly interface with other languages
          like C and C++ makes it versatile for various kinds of projects.

          Zig Best Practices and Coding Style Guide
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Prefer `const` and `var` over explicit types for local variables
            when the type is obvious.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Utilize Zig&apos;s built-in testing framework for unit tests.
          </li>
          <li>- Make use of compile-time checks to enforce safety.</li>
          <li>- Keep functions small and modular.</li>
          <li>- Document your code clearly to make it maintainable.</li>
        </ul>
