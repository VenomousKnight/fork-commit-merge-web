        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Elm?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Elm is a functional programming language known for building highly
          reliable and maintainable web applications. Its strict static typing
          and model-view-update (MVU) architecture reduce runtime errors, making
          it a preferred choice for web development. Elm compiles to JavaScript
          for seamless integration into web projects, emphasizing simplicity and
          robustness.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Elm?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Elm is chosen for web development due to its reliability,
          maintainability, and safety features. Its strict typing catches errors
          early, ensuring a stable and bug-free application. Elm&apos;s
          architecture simplifies code organization and state management, making
          it easier to maintain and extend. It also integrates seamlessly with
          JavaScript, making it a practical choice for web development while
          prioritizing developer productivity and safety.

          Elm Best Practices and Coding Style Guide
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Use camelCase for variables and functions, except for private ones
            that may start with underscores.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Employ PascalCase for user-defined types like classes and structs.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Use spaces for indentation, maintain a consistent four-space
            indent.
          </li>
          <li>
            - For functions and conditionals, open curly braces on the same
            line, close them on separate lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Aim for concise lines, typically 80-120 characters, for improved
            code readability.
          </li>
        </ul>
