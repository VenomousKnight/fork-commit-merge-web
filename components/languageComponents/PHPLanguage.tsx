        <p className="mb-4">
          PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a general-purpose scripting language
          especially suited for web development. Originally created by Rasmus
          Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has evolved to become one of the most widely used
          server-side languages, known for its role in dynamic web page
          creation.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use PHP?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          PHP is renowned for its simplicity and ease of use for newcomers. It
          provides robust support for various databases and web servers. It also
          boasts an extensive standard library and a vibrant community that
          contributes to an ever-growing ecosystem of libraries and frameworks,
          such as Laravel and Symfony.
