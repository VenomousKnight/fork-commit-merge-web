        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Java?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was
          initially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is
          platform-independent, meaning that code written in Java can run on any
          device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for
          building enterprise-scale web applications and Android mobile app
          development.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Java?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Java is known for its reliability, scalability, and ease of
          maintenance. It has a strong type system, automatic memory management,
          and a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a
          versatile choice for various types of projects. The language is also
          backed by a strong community of developers, providing excellent
          community support.
