        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Octave?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Octave is a high-level open-source programming language tailored for
          numerical computations and data analysis. It serves as an accessible
          alternative to MATLAB, offering a rich ecosystem for tasks such as
          signal processing, image analysis, and scientific modeling. Octave
          boasts a user-friendly interface, an extensive library of mathematical
          functions, and compatibility with MATLAB code, making it a favored
          tool for engineers, scientists, and researchers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Octave?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Octave is chosen for its capabilities in numerical computing, data
          analysis, and scientific research. Its open-source nature makes it an
          affordable option for individuals and organizations. Octave&apos;s
          compatibility with MATLAB simplifies code migration, and its extensive
          library of mathematical functions streamlines complex calculations.

          Octave Best Practices and Coding Style Guide
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Keep lines of code at 79 characters or fewer, using spaces for
            indentation and indenting by 2 spaces at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Place spaces after commas and before parentheses when calling
            functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Prefer lowercase names for variables, and uppercase is acceptable
            for variables consisting of 1-2 letters. Avoid mixed case names.
            Function names should be in lowercase.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Since function names are global, choose them thoughtfully and
            avoid potential conflicts.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Use # for comments exclusively and refrain from mixing % and # in
            the same file.
          </li>
        </ul>
