        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Dart?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Dart is an object-oriented, class-based programming language developed
          by Google. Initially released in 2011, it is designed for ease of use,
          strong support for modern web workflows, and robustness. Dart is used
          for building web, server, and mobile applications, and is also the
          language behind Flutter, Google&apos;s UI toolkit for building
          natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Dart?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Dart offers a blend of performance and productivity features. It is
          strongly typed, yet flexible, with a familiar syntax for Java and C#
          developers. Dart has a robust standard library and package ecosystem,
          and it can compile to native code for high performance across
          platforms. It is particularly popular for Flutter development.
