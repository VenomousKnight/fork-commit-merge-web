        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Clojure?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Clojure is a modern, functional programming language that runs on the
          Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It was created by Rich Hickey and released
          in 2007. Clojure is designed to be a general-purpose language, with an
          emphasis on simplicity, immutability, and leveraging the power of
          concurrent programming.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Clojure?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Clojure offers several advantages such as high performance via JVM,
          simplicity with its small set of powerful language constructs, and
          strong support for concurrent programming. It&apos;s also highly
          extensible and has a robust ecosystem, making it a solid choice for a
          variety of software projects, including web services and data
          analytics applications.
