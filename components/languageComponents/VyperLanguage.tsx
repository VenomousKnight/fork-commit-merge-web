        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Vyper?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Vyper is a Python-like programming language designed for Ethereum
          smart contracts. It is intended to be a more readable and secure
          alternative to Solidity, focusing on simplicity and ease of auditing.
          Unlike Solidity, Vyper deliberately avoids some advanced features to
          ensure greater security and readability.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Use Vyper?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Vyper offers a smaller attack surface due to its simplicity, making it
          a strong choice for projects prioritizing security. It produces more
          straightforward and easily auditable bytecode, facilitating code
          reviews and verification. Vyper also provides native support for
          common programming patterns in smart contracts.

          Vyper Best Practices and Coding Style Guide
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Stick to the established naming conventions for better
            readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Use comments and docstrings generously for easier code audits.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Be mindful of gas optimization, as Vyper contracts can be less
            gas-efficient than their Solidity counterparts.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Use Vyper&apos;s built-in decorators like @public and @private for
            better function visibility.
          </li>
        </ul>
