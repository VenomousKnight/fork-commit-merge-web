        <h2 className='mb-4 text-2xl font-bold'>What is Bash?</h2>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command language
          interpreter. It was developed as an enhanced version of the Bourne
          Shell and has been the default shell for Linux and macOS. Bash is
          widely used for its command-line and scripting capabilities.

        <h2 className='mb-4 text-2xl font-bold'>Why Use Bash?</h2>
        <p className='mb-6'>
          Bash is versatile and allows for a wide range of tasks including file
          manipulation, program execution, and even network communications. It
          is especially powerful when combined with other Unix utilities like
          awk, sed, and grep. Bash scripting can automate repetitive tasks,
          making it invaluable for system administration.

          <li>- Prefer `[[ ]]` over `[ ]` for tests.</li>
          <li>- Use `$()` for command substitution rather than backticks.</li>
