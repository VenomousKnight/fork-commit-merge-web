          Nim Best Practices and Coding Style Guide
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Keep lines within 80 characters in length. Use two spaces for
            indentation; tabs are not allowed, and the compiler enforces this
            rule.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Use PascalCase for type identifiers. For all other identifiers,
            including variables and functions, use camelCase, except for
            constants, which may use PascalCase but are not required to.
          </li>
          <li>
            - When defining exception and error types, add the &quot;Error&quot;
            or &quot;Defect&quot; suffix to their names.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Begin comments in Nim with the hash character (#). For multiline
            or block comments, start with #[ and end with ]#.
          </li>
